# CostIQ

**CostIQ** is a CFO-ready cost optimization diagnostic designed for mid-size hospitals.

It identifies avoidable operational spend in **procurement and inventory** using existing data exports — without system integrations or access to clinical data.

---

## What CostIQ Does

CostIQ analyzes hospital procurement and inventory data to surface:

- Vendor price inconsistencies  
- Contract vs invoice mismatches  
- Overstocking and expiry risk  
- High-cost purchasing patterns  

The output is a **clear, executive-ready diagnostic report** that helps finance and operations teams prioritize savings actions.

---

## How It Works

1. Hospitals export procurement and inventory data as CSV files  
2. CostIQ normalizes and analyzes the data using rule-based logic  
3. Findings are summarized in a CFO-ready PDF diagnostic  

Typical delivery time: **7–14 days**

## Who This Is For

- CFOs and finance leaders  
- Operations and supply chain teams  
- Mid-size hospitals (50–300 beds)  

---

## What CostIQ Is Not

- Not an ERP or BI tool  
- Not a clinical system  
- Not a continuous monitoring platform  
- Not dependent on AI experimentation
