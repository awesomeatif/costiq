# CostIQ Diagnostic Overview

CostIQ is a focused cost optimization diagnostic for hospitals.

The diagnostic reviews procurement and inventory data to identify
avoidable spend and operational inefficiencies that are often missed
by standard reporting.

The goal is to provide clarity — not dashboards — enabling finance
leaders to make defensible, near-term decisions.
